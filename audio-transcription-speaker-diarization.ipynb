(start=5.4s, end=10.4s)\nSpeaker 1: So this is so yeah, I totally understand why are you saying like you just need to go (start=10.4s, end=16.3s)\nSpeaker 1: down so it's better like if this specific part is from one one specific source you can (start=16.3s, end=22.2s)\nSpeaker 1: simply see okay this what's the source you can go to that page directly. (start=22.2s, end=26.3s)\nSpeaker 1: So I understand yeah that this is a good thing as well. (start=26.3s, end=32.1s)\nSpeaker 1: For sure. (start=32.1s, end=33.1s)\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so this is for medical. (start=33.1s, end=36.0s)\nSpeaker 1: This is a public record. (start=36.0s, end=39.5s)\nSpeaker 1: And now okay, no. (start=39.5s, end=42.9s)\nSpeaker 1: So what I was thinking first of all I was thinking there is no use of discovery assistance (start=42.9s, end=47.2s)\nSpeaker 1: but the good part is that in discovery assistance there is no validation okay. (start=47.2s, end=52.5s)\nSpeaker 1: So in that specific case probably it's okay. (start=52.5s, end=58.0s)\nSpeaker 2: So they can simply upload any kind of document. (start=58.0s, end=62.5s)\nSpeaker ?: Okay. (start=62.5s, end=66.5s)\nSpeaker 1: So we have sources again if we simply go case overview right to give it in the case overview (start=66.5s, end=76.1s)\nSpeaker 1: so if we simply go there it will be given that's the case overview there. (start=76.1s, end=81.0s)\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so there are multiple with yeah here it is. (start=81.0s, end=98.2s)\nSpeaker 1: It is telling about Cynthia Cummings and Cynthia Cummings operation number operation name (start=98.2s, end=108.1s)\nSpeaker 1: operation number. (start=108.1s, end=109.6s)\nSpeaker 1: We have these here okay then the time frame it took then we have key even then details (start=109.6s, end=116.1s)\nSpeaker 1: as well. (start=116.1s, end=117.1s)\nSpeaker 1: So for that probably we can go to yeah these are all the things like their allegation type (start=117.1s, end=123.2s)\nSpeaker 1: what allegations were there that it is simply telling about those as well. (start=123.2s, end=127.6s)\nSpeaker 1: Okay what investigation numbers were so this is the investigation number we can simply (start=127.6s, end=133.6s)\nSpeaker 1: say 364 so probably this one okay so it is just telling about all of us. (start=133.6s, end=140.8s)\nSpeaker 1: So obviously but when we simply have those embedded here it would be very easy for a user (start=140.8s, end=146.3s)\nSpeaker 1: to simply do. (start=146.3s, end=147.3s)\nSpeaker 1: So we have everything coming on we just need to embed those in here but I just need to (start=147.3s, end=151.8s)\nSpeaker 1: see if or what do you think like if the this streaming is not working with that so is that (start=151.8s, end=158.6s)\nSpeaker 1: okay with you. (start=158.6s, end=159.9s)\nSpeaker 3: Yeah that's a one quick question before we move forward those sources like it says seven (start=160.9s, end=167.2s)\nSpeaker 3: sources but you have go back up a little bit yeah you have like four key events right so (start=167.2s, end=177.1s)\nSpeaker 3: how would they know like which event just from the pages they have to kind of take a look (start=177.1s, end=181.9s)\nSpeaker 3: at the pages is that but then like the pages are not listed here in the sources are they. (start=181.9s, end=187.4s)\nSpeaker 1: No I didn't so that is why actually VIV I would be a troll of the better Taza scroll up (start=187.4s, end=196.0s)\nSpeaker 4: a bit on this response yeah so we got one two all right so we got one two three four (start=196.0s, end=201.6s)\nSpeaker 4: scroll down they have seven sources so they probably have to come. (start=201.6s, end=205.4s)\nSpeaker 4: Okay that's that's where the sources are okay so those pages right there that's the (start=205.4s, end=209.7s)\nSpeaker 4: reference to the sources so the each page is a source right that's what it is yes each (start=209.7s, end=214.7s)\nSpeaker 3: pages of source that's what this is saying so it's actually it's probably in an order too (start=214.7s, end=219.4s)\nSpeaker 4: right so like number one is listed one yeah yeah that makes sense so or Taza never mind disregard (start=219.4s, end=224.7s)\nSpeaker 4: what I said it that the pages are all right there that they need and yeah that yeah it is (start=224.7s, end=231.8s)\nSpeaker 1: this but it is a good thing Joshua if we can some about that I will simply ask it it is very (start=231.8s, end=237.2s)\nSpeaker 1: easier instead of going down you can see okay this is coming from the source you (start=237.2s, end=240.8s)\nSpeaker 1: simply click on it and you simply go there yeah exactly I'll try my best to simply get that done (start=240.8s, end=248.8s)\nSpeaker 1: so it is a good thing I like your idea there okay so now this is telling about this specific (start=248.8s, end=254.5s)\nSpeaker 1: investigation 741 741 is okay and based on that but obviously if we bet that it is a better (start=254.5s, end=262.4s)\nSpeaker 1: thing to do the same thing is being done in this career systems so we have the discovery (start=262.4s, end=268.7s)\nSpeaker 1: so let me tell you what is this is about (start=271.5s, end=277.0s)\nSpeaker 1: Joshua there is one document I tried my best to simply get it a process somehow and that was (start=279.7s, end=286.6s)\nSpeaker 1: many minds not many minds let me tell you which one it was (start=286.6s, end=290.4s)\nSpeaker 1: let me just check little berry the one which has some explicit content it was a rape case (start=293.7s, end=300.5s)\nSpeaker 1: probably I tried with open AI as well but still it's giving the content content realization (start=300.5s, end=307.1s)\nSpeaker 1: on only this document otherwise all the documents are being proceeded (start=310.2s, end=313.9s)\nSpeaker 1: so this specific document I know like we like before we were in Azure Open AI it has the same (start=319.5s, end=325.8s)\nSpeaker 1: issue now even we are on Open AI it is giving the same issues as well all right is there a way we (start=325.9s, end=334.1s)\nSpeaker 4: can get I know how to how we can get it in Azure we'd have to we don't qualify for that (start=334.1s, end=342.4s)\nSpeaker 1: unfortunately okay but maybe we can see in now Open AI I will go through this maybe there's (start=343.2s, end=349.1s)\nSpeaker 1: more content filters there somewhere so which we need to open again I'll read with it and (start=349.1s, end=355.6s)\nSpeaker 1: or maybe I can ask with Open AI support as well if they can give me something about that but that (start=355.8s, end=361.6s)\nSpeaker 1: is actually one document but probably there would be some of the documents which would have these (start=361.6s, end=367.2s)\nSpeaker 1: kind of things like explicit content or rape cases all we're going to have in Azure (start=367.2s, end=372.9s)\nSpeaker 1: mean for this is for sure for sure I'll simply send a message to support or I'll just (start=372.9s, end=379.6s)\nSpeaker 1: go through I'll dig into where we can simply minimize the content filtering there okay I'll (start=379.6s, end=385.9s)\nSpeaker 1: surely do that okay so this is like we are here for this we can simply push it to production (start=385.9s, end=394.0s)\nSpeaker 1: there is one only one small test again which I need to do so probably tomorrow I can simply push (start=394.0s, end=400.8s)\nSpeaker 1: it to production so you guys first of all you guys can test it out and then your people can test (start=400.8s, end=407.6s)\nSpeaker 1: that's what and based on that we can simply go from there there is one more thing Joshua we were (start=407.9s, end=414.6s)\nSpeaker 1: actually trying with all one okay first of all oh one doesn't take any kind of system prompt so (start=414.6s, end=420.8s)\nSpeaker 1: it there is another thing like which is they have actually developer tools or something through which (start=420.8s, end=427.7s)\nSpeaker 1: we simply need to pass things so we are we are seeing like how we can integrate oh one to get (start=427.7s, end=433.6s)\nSpeaker 1: the analysis okay but once it's done probably oh three is going to come so maybe oh three is (start=433.7s, end=439.7s)\nSpeaker 1: way better than so we can simply go to oh three directly for analysis but currently the analysis (start=439.7s, end=445.5s)\nSpeaker 1: is pretty good coming in we have optimized the fonts for that as well so once you simply go you will (start=445.5s, end=452.1s)\nSpeaker 1: see like it's coming good but probably oh three would have better formatting in terms of like (start=452.1s, end=458.6s)\nSpeaker 3: getting the text there a tazo one of the things I think maybe what used to be there in the (start=458.7s, end=464.8s)\nSpeaker 3: other in the earlier versions was you able to do an analysis can you write some notes (start=464.8s, end=469.2s)\nSpeaker 3: and save the notes while they while you view the we have it we have it I just didn't see it on the (start=470.5s, end=476.2s)\nSpeaker 1: screen yeah let me quickly show you yeah I'm gonna quickly show you so they're supposed to simply (start=476.2s, end=482.0s)\nSpeaker 1: have it here you can save this answer okay you can save this answer and from there you can go (start=482.0s, end=487.5s)\nSpeaker 1: and check the saved in the answers if there are multiple answers you can select and download a (start=487.5s, end=491.9s)\nSpeaker 1: PDF of it so we have we have we have that in all all of the documents not only in discovery no but (start=491.9s, end=498.0s)\nSpeaker 3: can't can they can they just like write a note related to like this to the save also (start=498.0s, end=505.7s)\nSpeaker 3: to the save like here so anywhere say they just want to after you highlight it a source and they (start=507.7s, end=515.7s)\nSpeaker 3: want to just add a little something you know so they can have some record of it oh you're (start=515.7s, end=520.9s)\nSpeaker 1: talking about annotations no actually we didn't have that we didn't have that actually but you're (start=520.9s, end=528.5s)\nSpeaker 1: saying like once we simply go let me quickly so once we are here on the document upload okay once (start=528.5s, end=536.8s)\nSpeaker 3: we are here so you here you are saying like we can no no no no just in the button you're in the (start=536.8s, end=543.1s)\nSpeaker 3: prompt but it's that only thing in anywhere here that I just remember that that lawyer that was (start=543.1s, end=547.5s)\nSpeaker 3: talking about it he said you know while he's talking to this and he's working chatting with the (start=547.5s, end=551.3s)\nSpeaker 3: prompt he wants to write some some notes to it also that was like a feature right he just want to (start=551.3s, end=557.4s)\nSpeaker 3: say say he wanted to say this so you know we can move on with this case or I need to I remind (start=557.4s, end=562.7s)\nSpeaker 3: I need to look at this case and send it to to lawyer be or something you know something like that (start=562.7s, end=566.6s)\nSpeaker 1: we can add a tab in here for notes and once you go there would be a complete editor you can (start=567.4s, end=572.2s)\nSpeaker 1: add multiple notes there probably and that would be safe we can do that not a problem if it's (start=572.2s, end=577.9s)\nSpeaker 1: if it's good so once we can simply add a tab in here notes once you go there you would have the (start=577.9s, end=583.8s)\nSpeaker 1: ability to write in and save one note okay you can name that note as well so they would be (start=583.8s, end=588.6s)\nSpeaker 3: multiple notes here yeah cuz I would think they probably would need something similar you know (start=588.6s, end=593.1s)\nSpeaker 1: but sure I can get that yeah I can get that not a problem not a problem at all okay thank you (start=593.1s, end=600.0s)\nSpeaker 1: yeah I'll get that done probably by I'll try my best it could be done tomorrow as well but I'll (start=600.6s, end=607.1s)\nSpeaker 1: let you know because there is one big back in APA we need to write and other than that this is a (start=607.1s, end=612.9s)\nSpeaker 1: great pretty fronted work we can do that no way I involved I will add an a notes for everyone (start=612.9s, end=621.3s)\nSpeaker 1: like for discovery and all the other documents as well for sure okay so yeah that's from my side (start=621.3s, end=635.3s)\nSpeaker 1: so Joshua I'm very hopeful to get all those kind of documents in and let's see once you once they (start=635.3s, end=644.4s)\nSpeaker 1: we have already like minimize the validation prompt as much as I could okay so it is a very basic (start=644.4s, end=653.0s)\nSpeaker 1: validation coming in but still let's see from the documents of the users like if they are simply (start=653.0s, end=659.7s)\nSpeaker 1: having validation error so then maybe we can simply write like if it's a public record that's all (start=659.7s, end=665.0s)\nSpeaker 1: otherwise we won't be giving multiple key points like it should have this it should have this it (start=665.0s, end=669.6s)\nSpeaker 1: should have that (start=669.6s, end=671.6s)\nSpeaker 1: got you yeah and I'll what I'll do I'll send you the prompts as well so if you think like if they (start=675.1s, end=682.3s)\nSpeaker 1: could be more minimized or something just let me because they have some some key points right now (start=682.3s, end=688.1s)\nSpeaker 1: which simply a i is validates like if these kind of things are there then obviously I'm going to (start=688.1s, end=694.4s)\nSpeaker 1: but probably public records are if they are almost the same then can you just give me an other (start=695.2s, end=701.3s)\nSpeaker 1: public record other than Ashley any any of them like any of them like which Ashley didn't give you (start=701.3s, end=708.8s)\nSpeaker 3: I think I still have some from the other demo right if you can just send me (start=710.4s, end=714.8s)\nSpeaker 3: I don't know if I shared it to you already or not but I park a reshare to you again no I know I (start=714.8s, end=719.3s)\nSpeaker 1: didn't get that if you can just send me one public record one medical analysis and one (start=719.3s, end=724.4s)\nSpeaker 1: pop police report somewhere okay I'll share what I have yeah please that would be great I can (start=724.4s, end=730.8s)\nSpeaker 1: simply go through that and based on that I can minimize the validation more no problem (start=730.8s, end=736.0s)\nSpeaker 1: so yeah that's it in here and (start=736.2s, end=745.2s)\nSpeaker 2: uh let me show you one thing (start=745.2s, end=751.9s)\nSpeaker ?: so (start=766.0s, end=773.3s)\nSpeaker 2: So can you see my screen? (start=796.0s, end=799.8s)\nSpeaker ?: Yep. (start=799.8s, end=801.8s)\nSpeaker 1: So we are working with the case management as so this is a design currently. (start=801.8s, end=806.4s)\nSpeaker 1: So like adding a case so we have to support the template. (start=806.4s, end=811.0s)\nSpeaker 1: So you can add a template. (start=811.0s, end=812.7s)\nSpeaker 1: So this one what this template would do it would simply ease for the user so they can create us. (start=812.7s, end=819.0s)\nSpeaker 1: Like same type of template and in the template what options we have. (start=819.0s, end=822.8s)\nSpeaker 1: Let me quickly show you that as well. (start=822.8s, end=824.5s)\nSpeaker 1: So you can upload but in creating a template what options do you have is. (start=825.5s, end=831.3s)\nSpeaker 1: Okay let me show you from here okay so you simply so all these things specifically responsible (start=833.2s, end=840.3s)\nSpeaker 1: selector these things and if if the the cases are almost the same with the related contents and so (start=840.3s, end=849.5s)\nSpeaker 1: some of the things would be there in the template so it would be easy for users so if this (start=849.5s, end=854.3s)\nSpeaker 1: somebody selected template or automatically those fields would be auto populated for them. (start=854.3s, end=859.1s)\nSpeaker 1: Okay so that's what he then we can simply write in the matter details like the case details. (start=859.1s, end=865.0s)\nSpeaker 1: What is who is the client what is the description who is responsible or is it who is originating it. (start=865.9s, end=873.3s)\nSpeaker 1: Reference number if any location practice area so they are multiple practice area administrative (start=874.1s, end=881.0s)\nSpeaker 1: bankruptcy, builder lines, whatever we can add the list then we have matter stage if it's in (start=881.0s, end=887.4s)\nSpeaker 1: discovery in trial or on hold like if it's open or already ended for us or something we just need (start=887.4s, end=895.3s)\nSpeaker 1: to do the entry open it close state status of limitations actually this was I'm not I personally don't (start=895.3s, end=903.1s)\nSpeaker 1: know what it is but I have seen in almost all kind of case management software's just this that (start=903.1s, end=910.6s)\nSpeaker 1: chewed off limitations data do you know about this what is it. (start=911.0s, end=914.8s)\nSpeaker 2: Gary your Dennis. (start=921.6s, end=922.4s)\nSpeaker 1: Probably not really sure but this is something important I have seen in almost all the case (start=928.4s, end=935.2s)\nSpeaker 1: but obviously once it's completed we can then verify it if it's needed or not. (start=936.0s, end=941.5s)\nSpeaker 5: Matters open dates close dates. (start=943.2s, end=946.1s)\nSpeaker 1: This one's that chewed off limitations this part. (start=947.7s, end=950.9s)\nSpeaker 5: That one is for us. (start=954.5s, end=955.8s)\nSpeaker 1: Adding a case. (start=958.4s, end=959.2s)\nSpeaker 3: But this is particular to cases yeah I guess that was important yeah I'm not sure I would have (start=959.4s, end=969.7s)\nSpeaker 3: to take a look do some research on that. (start=969.7s, end=971.6s)\nSpeaker 1: So then we can add the related context from directly here so once you simply add a content (start=973.5s, end=978.5s)\nSpeaker 1: context from here okay it would automatically be added to the context tab as well so we would have (start=978.5s, end=984.5s)\nSpeaker 1: that in here okay we are working on that like there would be tabs there so we will have complete (start=984.6s, end=992.8s)\nSpeaker 1: context like separately as well so once you simply add a content from here it would automatically (start=992.8s, end=1000.6s)\nSpeaker 1: be added there okay then we have billing preference so it is we we kept it very simply like if it's (start=1000.6s, end=1006.6s)\nSpeaker 1: a fixed fee okay then if it's a fixed fee you can simply write the fee recipient and monthly or (start=1006.6s, end=1013.1s)\nSpeaker 1: weekly and simply write it here if it's contingency fee you can simply write and amount (start=1013.1s, end=1019.2s)\nSpeaker 1: percentage like how much is done there would be like there would be a list of at and even every (start=1019.2s, end=1025.9s)\nSpeaker 1: field it is totally easy for the user so they can have the list as well and if they want to write (start=1025.9s, end=1031.6s)\nSpeaker 1: it directly they can write it directly so we are given both both options to the user because when (start=1031.6s, end=1037.9s)\nSpeaker 1: adding a case there there could be multiple entries and like very separate entries then if there are (start=1038.0s, end=1044.3s)\nSpeaker 1: some other like already they know some tasks they can start adding those tasks as well from the (start=1044.3s, end=1049.6s)\nSpeaker 1: task and documents as well once they simply are ready with that they can simply save that matter or (start=1049.6s, end=1056.2s)\nSpeaker 1: save case okay okay tell me like what is more feasible for you case or matter I've seen both (start=1056.2s, end=1063.6s)\nSpeaker 1: how would say case yeah I because cases like normal because I know at the case like cases normally (start=1068.6s, end=1078.9s)\nSpeaker 1: spoken everywhere but I have seen matter as well so we can make it case all over okay so based on that (start=1078.9s, end=1089.2s)\nSpeaker 1: like all the so we are working on all other things as well like documents documents (start=1089.5s, end=1097.2s)\nSpeaker 1: billing, context and all those things so once they are you would be able to see them separately as well (start=1097.2s, end=1104.2s)\nSpeaker 1: but with the cases so once you simply we are working with the now the dashboard of the matters like how (start=1104.2s, end=1110.3s)\nSpeaker 1: like all those things would be reflected there so you can quickly check that and then you would (start=1111.1s, end=1116.4s)\nSpeaker 1: be able to see all other things as well so probably you can say by the next week like 60-70 (start=1116.4s, end=1121.9s)\nSpeaker 1: percent of the designs would be completed for the whole case management but I have already asked (start=1121.9s, end=1128.2s)\nSpeaker 1: my friend to developer to start about the case one so they can work on the front end design of it perfect (start=1128.2s, end=1137.0s)\nSpeaker 1: so that's all from us yeah that's all from us today I have two things to note one is if we can (start=1137.0s, end=1148.6s)\nSpeaker 1: embed the sources in that and the other thing is the notes one which I can I totally know we can (start=1148.6s, end=1155.0s)\nSpeaker 1: do not a problem I will add the notes down in there absolutely sounds good thank you thank you (start=1155.0s, end=1165.6s)\nSpeaker 1: so much very thank you so much for today and I'll give you updated once these things are done and (start=1165.6s, end=1171.2s)\nSpeaker 1: once we push everything into production so you guys can test it that's perfect I appreciate all (start=1171.2s, end=1177.0s)\nSpeaker 4: your hard work or tazza thanks so much dude thank you you guys pushing out the production those (start=1177.0s, end=1181.9s)\nSpeaker 4: changes in today so we can I can show Ashley this stuff tomorrow for sure for sure I will let you (start=1181.9s, end=1188.0s)\nSpeaker 4: okay and then can we also do me one favor when we go live can you purge the database of all of our (start=1189.6s, end=1194.9s)\nSpeaker 4: current clients and everything in production I want a fresh one and then can we at some point (start=1194.9s, end=1204.0s)\nSpeaker 4: put into the the backlog to get some functionality around us being able to log in with our sparkfire (start=1204.0s, end=1210.4s)\nSpeaker 4: aliases and in the admin panel and stuff you can do that already I know it's with Bob the AI (start=1210.4s, end=1218.8s)\nSpeaker 4: aliases I was wondering if you get updated to our sparkfire aliases and then kind of give us like (start=1218.8s, end=1224.0s)\nSpeaker 1: a sauce group is for the admin for the admin yeah okay I can I can remove them as well and I can (start=1224.0s, end=1231.1s)\nSpeaker 1: create like on all of like for three of you yeah with our sparkfire aliases please okay and then (start=1231.1s, end=1239.6s)\nSpeaker 4: let us be able to create new users to please them users soon when I get my support guys out there (start=1239.6s, end=1244.4s)\nSpeaker 1: and I can just you can do that yeah you can do that from the admin panel once I create your aliases (start=1244.4s, end=1249.4s)\nSpeaker 1: so you would be able to do that perfect perfect sounds very good yeah that's all I'll keep you updated (start=1249.5s, end=1260.0s)\nSpeaker 1: about those things okay okay great thank you thank you Joshua thank you Dennis Jerry it was (start=1260.0s, end=1270.6s)\nSpeaker 1: very nice I can do you guys all right Tazza thank you thank you have a good day goodbye (start=1270.6s, end=1279.8s)\n\n Transcript saved as:
